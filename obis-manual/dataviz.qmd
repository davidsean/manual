## Example notebooks using data from OBIS

Here are a few R notebooks showcasing the robis package:

- [Data exploration of wind farm monitoring datasets in OBIS](https://iobis.github.io/notebook-windfarms/)
- [Diversity of fish and vulnerable species in Marine World Heritage Sites based on OBIS data](https://iobis.github.io/notebook-mwhs/)
- [Data exploration - Stratified random surveys (StRS) of reef fish in the U.S. Pacific Islands](https://iobis.github.io/notebook-reeffish/)
- [DNADerivedData extension data access](https://iobis.github.io/notebook-dnaderiveddata/)
- [Canary Current LME](https://iobis.github.io/notebook-cclme/)

## obisindicators: calculating & visualizing spatial biodiversity using data from OBIS

[obisindicators](https://marinebon.org/obisindicators/index.html) is an R library developed during the [2022 IOOS Code Sprint](https://ioos.github.io/ioos-code-sprint/). The purpose was to create an ES50 diversity index within hexagonal grids following the [diversity indicators notebook](https://iobis.github.io/notebook-diversity-indicators/) by Pieter Provoost linked above. The package includes several examples, limited to 1M occurrences, that demonstrate uses of the package.
