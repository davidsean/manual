It provides guidelines for OBIS nodes and data providers on the OBIS standards and data management best practices to ensure that data published via OBIS are of high quality and follows internationally recognised standards. It also provides guidelines for data users on how to access, process and visualize data from OBIS. The OBIS node manual is a dynamic document and is revised on a regular basis. Suggestions for additions and changes to this document are welcome and can be sent to the OBIS Capacity Development Task Team by email to training@obis.org or added as issues at https://github.com/iobis/manual/issues. 1.1 Guidelines on the sharing and use of data in OBIS It is important that our data providers as well as all the data users are aware and agree on the OBIS guidelines on the sharing and use of data in OBIS, which was adoped at the 4th OBIS Steering Group. 1.2 Acknowledgements This manual received contributions from: Leen Vandepitte, Mary Kennedy, Philip Goldstein, Pieter Provoost, Samuel Bosch and Ward Appeltans. "],["policy.html", "1.3 Data Policy", " 1.3 Data Policy 1.3.1 Guidelines on the sharing and use of data in OBIS Adopted at SG-OBIS-IV (Feb 2015) and IODE-XXIII (March 2015). The OBIS data policy is based on the principles of timely, free and unrestricted access to biodiversity data for the benefit of science and society, as defined in the: IOC data exchange policy IOC guidelines on transfer of marine technology IODE objectives OBIS vision and mission Unless data are collected through activities funded by IOC/IODE, neither UNESCO, IOC, IODE, the OBIS Secretariat, nor its employees or contractors, own the data in OBIS and they take no responsibility for the quality of data or products based on OBIS, or the use or misuse that people may make of them nor can it control or limit the use of any data or products accessible through its website, other than through the use of a published Data Sharing and Use Terms and Conditions. 1.3.1.1 Data sharing agreement The data providers retain all rights and responsibilities associated with the data they make available to OBIS via the OBIS nodes. The OBIS nodes warrant that they have made the necessary agreements with the original data providers that it can make the data available to OBIS data under the following Creative Commons licenses: CC-0 CC-BY CC-BY-NC CC-0 is the preferred one and CC-BY-NC the least preferred. The data providers are responsible for the completeness of the data and metadata profiles. When data is made available to OBIS, OBIS is granted permission to: Distribute the data via its data and information portal Build an integrated database, use the data for data quality control purposes, complement the data with other data such as climate variables and build value-added information products and services for science and decision-making Serve the data to other similar open-access networks such as GBIF in compliance with the terms and conditions for use set by the data providers. In pursuance of copyright compliance, OBIS endeavours to secure permission from rights holders to ingest their datasets. In the event that the inclusion of a dataset in OBIS is challenged on the basis of copyright infringement, OBIS will follow a take-down policy until there is resolution. 1.3.1.2 Data use agreement The data in OBIS are freely available to everyone, following the principles of equitable access and benefit sharing and supporting capacity development and participation of all IOC Member States in global programmes. However, data users are expected to give attribution to the data providers (see Citations) and the use of data from OBIS should happen in the light of fair use, i.e.: Recognize that the OBIS portal holds the master copy of the integrated database and hence users should refrain from online redistribution of the OBIS database. Because the OBIS database is updated regularly (every so months) with new datasets and revisions of existing datasets, copies of the OBIS database will become out of date quickly. If you wish to build access web services on top of OBIS, please contact the OBIS secretariat. Respect the data providers, and provide helpful feedback on data quality. In the case you are a custodian of biogeographic data yourself you should take action to also publish these data through OBIS. Consider sponsoring or partnering with OBIS and its OBIS nodes in grant proposal writing. Creating a global database like OBIS cannot happen without the, often voluntary, contribution of many scientists and data managers all over the world. Several activities, such as the coordination, data aggregation, quality control, database and website maintenance require resources including manpower at national and international level. A list of sponsors can be found here 1.3.1.3 Citations General OBIS citation: OBIS (YEAR) Ocean Biodiversity Information System. Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO. www.obis.org.

Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO. www.obis.org. Accessed: YYYY-MM-DD) 1.3.1.4 Disclaimer Appropriate caution is necessary in the interpretation of results derived from OBIS. Users must recognize that the analysis and interpretation of data require background knowledge and expertise about marine biodiversity (including ecosystems and taxonomy). Users should be aware of possible errors, including in the use of species names, geo-referencing, data handling, and mapping. They should crosscheck their results for possible errors, and qualify their interpretation of any results accordingly. Unless data are collected through activities funded by IOC/IODE, neither UNESCO, IOC, IODE, the OBIS Secretariat, nor its employees or contractors, own the data in OBIS and they take no responsibility for the quality of data or products based on OBIS, or the use or misuse. "],["contribute.html", "2 Contribute data to OBIS", " 2 Contribute data to OBIS OBIS accepts data from any organization, consortium, project or individual who wants to contribute data. OBIS Data Sources are the authors, editors, and/or organisations that have published one or more datasets through OBIS. They are the owners or custodians of the data, not OBIS! However, OBIS only harvests data from recognized OBIS nodes. If you own data or have the right to share data with OBIS, you can contact the OBIS secretariat or one of the OBIS nodes. Your organization or programme can also become an OBIS node. "],["nodes.html", "2.1 OBIS nodes", " 2.1 OBIS nodes OBIS Nodes are either national projects, programmes, institutes or organizations, National Ocean Data Centers or regional or international projects, programmes and institutions or organization that carry out data management functions. OBIS nodes are responsible for representing all aspects of OBIS within a particular region or taxonomic domain. The node is intended to establish relationships with key data providers within their geographical (or taxonomic) area of responsibility and bring data and corresponding meta data into the global database to be shared with the OBIS community. Nodes are responsible for all aspects of the data from gaining permission to provide access to the data, to ensuring a certain level of data quality and for the transfer of these datasets to the global OBIS database. In addition, Nodes provide support for the full implementation of OBIS worldwide by serving on the IODE Steering Group for OBIS and any relevant Task Teams. Each node may also maintain a data presence on the Internet representing their specific area of responsibility. The OBIS system architecture is structured on the basis of three tiers of OBIS nodes. At tier I is the aggregate global database and is managed by the project office in Ostend (Belgium). Tier I is also responsible for providing data access, web services, statistics and data products. Tier II nodes are responsible for many of the quality control and other data management tasks that were originally born by the global database. This helps to reduce the cost born by the Project Office and build a stronger network capacity. An added benefit of this structure is the ability to accept tier III nodes. These tier III nodes are willing participants in adding data to the OBIS network, but may not have the expertise or resource base to meet all of the responsibilities of a tier II node. The addition of tier III nodes provides two added benefits to the network. First, expanded capacity for reaching out to the science community and second an opportunity for larger tier II nodes to mentor smaller or new member nodes. Tier II and III nodes will coordinate outreach to respective data providers. Only Tier II and global thematic taxonomic Nodes would feed the global dataset directly. 2.1.1 Terms of Reference of OBIS nodes Receiving or harvesting marine biodiversity data (and metadata) from national, regional and international programs, and the scientific community at large, and from tier III nodes by tier II nodes, and from tier II nodes by tier I nodes Perform data validation (using standards, tools and best practices), as described in the OBIS manual (Tier II) Reporting the results of quality control directly to data collectors/originator (or tier III node) as part of the quality assurance activity Making data (and metadata) available to OBIS using agreed upon standards and formats which are described in the OBIS Manual (Tier II), making data available to tier II nodes (Tier III) Become a member of the IODE steering group for OBIS, attend the SG-OBIS annual meeting and report on node activities Provide indicators on up-time, responsiveness and data processed by nodes and present a report to SG-OBIS Customer support (data queries, analyses, feedback). Outreach and Capacity Building (i.e., providing expertise, training and support in data management, technologies, standards and best practices). Control data access, terms of use and sharing policies Comply with the IOC/OBIS data policy for using and sharing OBIS data Build customized data portals (optional) Engage in stakeholder groups (recommended) Contribute to the development of standards and best practices in OBIS (recommended) Contribute to the development of open-source tools in OBIS (recommended) Ensuring the long-term preservation of the data, metadata and associated information required for correct interpretation of the data (including version-control) (recommended) 2.1.2 How to become an OBIS node OBIS nodes now operate under the IODE network as either National Oceanographic Data Centres (NODCs) or Associate Data Unites (ADUs). Prospective nodes are required to apply to the IODE for membership. The procedure to become an OBIS node is as follows: If you are an existing NODC (within the IODE network) and the OBIS node activities fall under the activities of the NODC: Send a letter expressing your interest to become an OBIS node (including contact information of the OBIS node manager, and geographical/thematic scope of your OBIS node) If you are not an existing NODC: Email your application form to become an IODE Associate Data Unit (ADU), with a specific role as OBIS node. Applications for ADU membership in OBIS shall be reviewed by the IODE Officers in consultation with the IODE Steering Group for OBIS. 2.1.3 OBIS Node Health Status Check and Transition Strategy OBIS nodes should operate under IODE as either IODE/ADU or IODE/NODC. As such OBIS nodes are a member of the IODE network. The IODE Steering Group (SG) for OBIS evaluates the health status of OBIS nodes at each annual SG meeting, and considers an OBIS node as inactive when it meets any of the following conditions: The OBIS node manager recurrently fails to answer the communications from the project manager or the SG co-chairs in the last 12 months The OBIS node manager or a representative fails to attend (personally or virtually) the last 2 SG meetings without any written reason The OBIS node does not have an IPT The OBIS node has an IPT, but it has not been running for the last 12 months The datasets in the OBIS node’s IPT have been removed and not restored in the last 12 months (without any explanation) The OBIS node has not provided new data for the last 2 years The OBIS Secretariat prepares a health status check report of each OBIS node based on the six items above and informs the OBIS node manager on their status 3 months before the SG meeting. At the SG meeting, the SG-OBIS co-chair will present the results of the OBIS nodes health status check report including a listing of the inactive OBIS nodes. The SG-OBIS members representing active OBIS Nodes will make one of the following decisions: Request the inactive OBIS node to submit a plan with actions, deliverables and times to improve their performance, within 3 months, to the OBIS Secretariat. This plan is reviewed and accepted by the OBIS-Executive Committee Or Provide a recommendation to the IOC Committee on IODE to remove the OBIS node from the IODE network. In either case, the OBIS Secretariat will inform the OBIS node manager of the SG-OBIS decision, with a copy to the IODE officers and the IODE national coordinator for data management of the country concerned. The IODE Committee is requested to consider the recommendation from the OBIS Steering Group and it may either accept the recommendation or request the inactive OBIS node to submit an action plan (option 1). When the inactive OBIS node is removed from the IODE network, the SG-OBIS will ask whether another OBIS node is interested in taking over the responsibilities of the removed OBIS node, until a new OBIS node in the country/region is established. "],["data_standards.html", "2.2 Biodiversity data standards", " 2.2 Biodiversity data standards From the very beginning, OBIS has championed the use of international standards for biogeographic data. Without agreement on the application of standards and protocols, OBIS would not have been able to build a large central database. OBIS uses the following standards: Darwin Core Ecological Metadata Language Darwin Core Archive and dataset structure Dataset Examples "],["darwin_core.html", "", " 2.2.1 Darwin Core Contents Introduction to Darwin Core Darwin Core terms Darwin Core guidelines Taxonomy and identification Occurrence Record level terms Location Event Time Sampling 2.2.1.1 Introduction to Darwin Core Darwin Core is a body of standards for biodiversity informatics. It provides stable terms and vocabularies for sharing biodiversity data. Darwin Core is maintained by TDWG (Biodiversity Information Standards, formerly The International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases). The old OBIS schema was an OBIS extension to Darwin Core 1.2., which was based on Simple Darwin Core, a subset of Darwin Core which does not allow any structure beyond rows and columns. It added some terms which were important for OBIS, but were not supported by Darwin Core at the time (e.g. start and end date and start and end latitude and longitude, depth range, lifestage and terms for abundance, biomass and sample size). In 2009, the Executive Committee of TDWG announced their ratification of an updated version of Darwin Core as a TDWG Standard. Ratified Darwin Core unifies specializations and innovations emerge from diverse communities, and provides guidelines for ongoing enhancement. The Darwin Core Quick Reference Guide links to TDWG’s term definitions and related practices for Ratified Darwin Core. In December 2013, the 3rd session of the IODE Steering Group for OBIS agreed to transition OBIS globally to the TDWG-Ratified version of Darwin Core, and the mapping of the (old) OBIS specific terms to Darwin Core can be found here. 2.2.1.2 Darwin Core terms DwC terms correspond to the column names of your dataset. A list of all possible Darwin Core terms can be found on TDWG. Below is an overview of the most relevant Darwin Core terms to consider when contributing to OBIS, with guidelines regarding their use. Note that OBIS currently has eight required DwC terms: occurrenceID, eventDate, decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude, scientificName, scientificNameID, occurrenceStatus, basisOfRecord. The following DwC terms are related to the Class Taxon: scientificName scientificNameID scientificNameAuthorship kingdom taxonRank taxonRemarks The following DwC terms are related to the Class Identification: identifiedBy dateIdentified identificationReferences identificationRemarks identificationQualifier typeStatus The following DwC terms are related to the Class Occurrence: occurrenceID occurrenceStatus recordedBy individualCount (OBIS recommends to add measurements to eMoF) organismQuantity (OBIS recommends to add measurements to eMoF) organismQuantityType (OBIS recommends to add measurements to eMoF) sex (OBIS recommends to add measurements to eMoF) lifeStage (OBIS recommends to add measurements to eMoF) behavior associatedTaxa occurrenceRemarks associatedMedia associatedReferences associatedSequences catalogNumber preparations The following DwC terms are related to the Class Record level: basisOfRecord institutionCode collectionCode collectionID bibliographicCitation modified dataGeneralizations The following DwC terms are related to the Class Location: decimalLatitude decimalLongitude coordinateUncertaintyInMeters geodeticDatum footprintWKT minimumDepthInMeters maximumDepthInMeters locality waterBody islandGroup island country locationAccordingTo locationRemarks locationID The following DwC terms are related to the Class Event: parentEventID eventID eventDate type habitat samplingProtocol (OBIS recommends to add sampling facts to eMoF) sampleSizeValue (OBIS recommends to add sampling facts to eMoF) SampleSizeUnit (OBIS recommends to add sampling facts to eMoF) samplingEffort (OBIS recommends to add sampling facts to eMoF) The following DwC terms are related to the Class MaterialSample: materialSampleID 2.2.1.3 Darwin Core guidelines 2.2.1.3.1 Taxonomy and identification scientificName (required term) should always contain the originally recorded scientific name, even if the name is currently a synomym. This is necessary to be able to track back records to the original dataset. The name should be at the lowest possible taxonomic rank, preferably at species level or lower, but higher ranks, such as genus, family, order, class etc are also acceptable. We recommend to not include authorship in scientificName, and only use scientificNameAuthorship for that purpose. The scientificName term should only contain the name and not identification qualifications (such as ?, confer or affinity), which should instead be supplied in the IdentificationQualifier term, see examples below. taxonRemarks can capture comments or notes about the taxon or name. A WoRMS LSID should be added in scientificNameID (required term), OBIS will use this identifier to pull the taxonomic information from the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) into OBIS, such as the taxonomic classification and the accepted name in case of invalid names or synonyms. LSIDs are persistent, location-independent, resource identifiers for uniquely naming biologically significant resources. More information on LSIDs can be found at www.lsid.info. For example, the WoRMS LSID for Solea solea is: urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:127160, and can be found at the bottom of each WoRMS taxon page, e.g. Solea solea. kingdom and taxonRank can help us in identifying the provided scientificName in case the name is not available in WoRMS. kingdom in particular can help us find alternative genus-species combinations and avoids linking the name to homonyms. Please contact the WoRMS data management team (info@marinespecies.org) in case the scientificName is missing in WoRMS. kingdom and taxonRank are not necessary when a correct scientificNameID is provided. OBIS recommends providing information about how an identification was made, for example by which ID key, species guide or expert; and by which method (e.g morphology vs. genomics), etc. The person’s name who made the taxonomic identification can go in identifiedBy and when in dateIdentified. Use the ISO 8601:2004(E) standard for date and time, for instructions see Time. A list of references, such as field guides used for the identification can be listed in identificationReferences. Any other information, such as identification methods, can be added to identificationRemarks. Examples: | scientificNameID | scientificName | kingdom | phylum | class | |-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------|----------|------------| | urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:142004 | Yoldiella nana | Animalia | Mollusca | Bivalvia | | urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:140584 | Ennucula tenuis | Animalia | Mollusca | Bivalvia | | urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:131573 | Terebellides stroemii | Animalia | Annelida | Polychaeta | | order | family | genus | specificEpithet | scientificNameAuthorship | |-------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------| | Nuculanoida | Yoldiidae | Yoldiella | nana | (Sars M., 1865) | | Nuculoida | Nuculidae | Ennucula | tenuis | (Montagu, 1808) | | Terebellida | Trichobranchidae | Terebellides | stroemii | Sars, 1835 | Data from Benthic fauna around Franz Josef Land. If the record represents a nomenclatural type specimen, the term typeStatus can be used, e.g. for holotype, syntype, etc. In case of uncertain identifications, and the scientific name contains qualifiers such as cf., ? or aff., then this name should go in identificationQualifier, and scientificName should contain the name of the lowest possible taxon rank that refers to the most accurate identification. E.g. if the specimen was accurately identified down to genus level, but not species level, then the scientificName should contain the name of the genus, the scientificNameID should contain the LSID the genus and the identificationQualifier should contain the uncertain species name combined with ? or other qualifiers. The table belowe shows a few examples: The use and definitions for additional NO signs (identificationQualifier) can be found in Open Nomenclature in the biodiversity era, which provides examples for using the main Open Nomenclature qualifiers associated with physical specimens. The publication Recommendations for the Standardisation of Open Taxonomic Nomenclature for Image-Based Identiﬁcations provides examples and definitions for identificationQualifiers for non-physical specimens (image-based).

If the dataset does not yet contain (globally unique) occurrenceIDs, then they should be created. There are no guidelines yet on designing the persistence of this ID, the level of uniqueness (from dataset to global) and the precise algorithm and format for generating the ID, but in the absence of a persistent globally unique identifier, one could be constructed by combining the institutionCode, the collectionCode and the catalogNumber (or autonumber in the absence of a catalogNumber), see further below. Note that the inclusion of occurrenceID is also necessary for datasets in the OBIS-ENV-DATA format. occurrenceStatus (required term) is a statement about the presence or absence of a taxon at a location. It is an important term, because it allows us to distinguish between presence and absence records. It is a required term and should be filled in with either present or absent. A few terms related to quantity: organismQuantity and organismQuantityType, have been added to the TDWG ratified Darwin Core. This is a lot more versatile than the older individualCount field. However, OBIS recommends to use the Extended MeasurementorFact extension for quantitative measurements because of the standardization of terms and the fact that you can link these measurements to sampling events and factual sampling information. Please take note that OBIS recommends all quantitative measurements and sampling facts to be treated in the ExtendedMeasurementOrFact extension and not in the Darwin Core files. In the case specimens were collected and stored (e.g. museum collections), the catalogNumber and preparations terms can be used to provide the identifier for the record in the collection and to document the preparation and preservation methods. The term typeStatus see above (under identification) can be used in this context too. Both associatedMedia, associatedReferences and associatedSequences are global unique identifiers or URIs pointing to respectively associated media (e.g. online image or video), associated literature (e.g. DOIs) or genetic sequence information (e.g. GenBANK ID). associatedTaxa include a list (concatenated and separated) of identifiers or names of taxa and their associations with the Occurrence, e.g. the species occurrence was associated to the presence of kelp such as Laminaria digitata. The recommended vocabulary for sex see BODC vocab : S10, for lifeStage see BODC vocab: S11, behavior (no vocab available), and occurrenceRemarks can hold any comments or notes about the Occurrence. recordedBy can hold a list (concatenated and separated) of names of people, groups, or organizations responsible for recording the original Occurrence. The primary collector or observer, especially one who applies a personal identifier (recordNumber), should be listed first. Example: | collectionCode | occurrenceID | catalogNumber | occurrenceStatus | |------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------| | SluiceDock_benthic_1976/1981 | SluiceDock_benthic_1976_1 | SluiceDock_benthic_1976_1 | present | | SluiceDock_benthic_1976/1981 | SluiceDock_benthic_1976_2 | SluiceDock_benthic_1976_2 | present | | SluiceDock_benthic_1976/1981 | SluiceDock_benthic_1979-07/1980-06_1 | SluiceDock_benthic_1979-07/1980-06_1 | present | Data from A summary of benthic studies in the sluice dock of Ostend during 1976-1981. 2.2.1.3.3 Record level terms basisOfRecord (required term) specifies the nature of the record, i.e. whether the occurrence record is based on a stored specimen or an observation. In case the specimen is collected and stored in a collection (e.g. at a museum, university, research institute), the options are PreservedSpecimen (e.g. preserved in ethanol, tissue etc.), FossilSpecimen (fossil, which allows OBIS to make the distinction between the date of collection and the time period the specimen was assumed alive) or LivingSpecimen (an intentionally kept/cultivated living specimen e.g. in an aquarium or culture collection). In case no specimen is deposited, the basis of record is either HumanObservation (e.g bird sighting, benthic sample but specimens were discarded after counting), or MachineObservation (e.g. for occurrences based on automated sensors such as DNA sequencers, image recognition etc). When the basisOfRecord is a preservedSpecimen, LivingSpecimen or FossilSpecimen please also add the institutionCode, collectionCode and catalogNumber, which will enable people to visit the collection and re-examine the material. Sometimes, for example in case of living specimens, a dataset can contain records pointing to the origin, the in-situ sampling position as well as a record referring to the ex-situ collection. In this case please add the event type information in type (see OBIS manual: event). institutionCode identifies the custodian institute (often by acronym), collectionCode identifies the collection or dataset within that institute. Collections cannot belong to multiple institutes, so all records within a collection should have the same institutionCode. The catalogNumber is an identifier for the record within the dataset or collection. As explained before, the occurrenceID could for example be constructed by combining the institutionCode, collectionCode and catalogNumber: Example: | modified | institutionCode | collectionCode | |---------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------| | 2017-02-27 15:47:31 | Ugent | Vegetation_Gazi_Bay(Kenya)1987 | | 2017-02-27 15:47:31 | Ugent | Vegetation_Gazi_Bay(Kenya)1987 | | 2017-02-27 15:47:31 | Ugent | Vegetation_Gazi_Bay(Kenya)1987 | | basisOfRecord | occurrenceID | catalogNumber | |------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------| | HumanObservation | Ugent_Vegetation_Gazi_Bay(Kenya)1987_7553 | Ugent_Vegetation_Gazi_Bay(Kenya)1987_7553 | | HumanObservation | Ugent_Vegetation_Gazi_Bay(Kenya)1987_7554 | Ugent_Vegetation_Gazi_Bay(Kenya)1987_7554 | | HumanObservation | Ugent_Vegetation_Gazi_Bay(Kenya)1987_7555 | Ugent_Vegetation_Gazi_Bay(Kenya)1987_7555 | Data from Algal community on the pneumatophores of mangrove trees of Gazi Bay in July and August 1987. bibliographicCitation allows for providing different citations on record level, while a single citation for the entire dataset can and should be provided in the metadata (see EML). The citation at record level can have the format of a chapter in a book, where the book is the dataset citation. The record citation will have preference over the dataset citation. We do not, however, recommend to create different citations for every record, as this will explode the number of citations and will hamper the re-use of data. modified is the most recent date-time on which the resource was changed. It is required to use the ISO 8601:2004(E) standard, for instructions see Time. dataGeneralizations refers to actions taken to make the shared data less specific or complete than in its original form. Suggests that alternative data of higher quality may be available on request. This can be the case for occurrences of vulnerable or endangered species and there positions are converted to the center of grid cells. 2.2.1.3.4 Location decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude (required terms) are the geographic latitude and longitude (in decimal degrees), using the spatial reference system given in geodeticDatum of the geographic center of a Location. The number of decimals should be appropriate for the level of uncertainty in coordinateUncertaintyInMeters (at least within an order of magnitude). coordinateUncertaintyInMeters is the radius of the smallest circle around the given position containing the whole location. Regarding decimalLatitude, positive values are north of the Equator, negative values are south of it. All values lie between -90 and 90, inclusive. Regarding decimalLongitude, positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it. All values lie between -180 and 180, inclusive. In OBIS, the spatial reference system to be documented in geodeticDatum is EPSG:4326. Coordinates in degrees/minutes/seconds can be converted to decimal degrees using our coordinates tool. We also provide a tool to check coordinates or to determine coordinates for a location (point, transect or polygon) on a map. This tool also allows geocoding location names using marineregions.org. The name of the place or location can be provided in locality, and if possible linked by a locationID using a persistent ID from a gazetter, such as the MRGID from MarineRegions. If the species occurrence only contains the name of the locality, but not the exact coordinates, we recommend using a geocoding service to obtain the coordinates. Marine Regions has a search interface for geographic names, and provides coordinates and often precision in meters, which can go into coordinateUncertaintyInMeters. Another option is to use the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names or Google Maps: after looking up a location, the decimal coordinates can be found in the page URL. Additional information about the locality can also be stored in DwC terms such as waterBody, islandGroup, island and country. locationAccordingTo should provide the name of the gazetteer that is used to obtain the coordinates for the locality. locationID is an identifier for the set of location information (e.g. station ID, or MRGID from marineregions), for example the Balearic Plain has MRGID: http://marineregions.org/mrgid/3956. A Well-Known Text (WKT) representation of the shape of the location can be provided in footprintWKT. This is particularly useful for tracks, transects, tows, trawls, habitat extent or when an exact location is not known. WKT strings can be created using our WKT tool. This tool also calculates a midpoint and a radius, which can then be added to decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude, and coordinateUncertaintyInMeters respectively. There is also an R tool to calculate the centroid and radius for WKT polygons. wktmap.com can be used to visualize and share WKT strings. Some examples of WKT strings: LINESTRING (30 10, 10 30, 40 40) POLYGON ((30 10, 40 40, 20 40, 10 20, 30 10)) MULTILINESTRING ((10 10, 20 20, 10 40),(40 40, 30 30, 40 20, 30 10)) MULTIPOLYGON (((30 20, 45 40, 10 40, 30 20)),((15 5, 40 10, 10 20, 5 10, 15 5))) Keep in mind while filling in minimumDepthInMeters and maximumDepthInMeters that this should be the depth at which the sample was taken and not the water column depth at that location. Example: | decimalLatitude | decimalLongitude | geodeticDatum | coordinateUncertaintyInMeters | footprintWKT | footprintSRS | |-----------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------| | 38.698 | 20.95 | EPSG:4326 | 75033.17 | LINESTRING (20.31 39.15, 21.58 38.24) | EPSG:4326 | | 42.72 | 15.228 | EPSG:4326 | 154338.87 | LINESTRING (16.64 41.80, 13.82 43.64) | EPSG:4326 | | 39.292 | 20.364 | EPSG:4326 | 162083.27 | LINESTRING (19.05 40.34, 21.68 38.25) | EPSG:4326 | Data from Adriatic and Ionian Sea mega-fauna monitoring employing ferry as platform of observation along the Ancona-Igoumenitsa-Patras lane, from December 2014 to December 2018. 2.2.1.3.5 Event eventID is an identifier for the sampling or observation event. parentEventID is an identifier for a parent event, which is composed of one or more sub-sampling (child) events (eventIDs). eventID can be used for replicate samples or sub-samples. Make sure each replicate sample receives a unique event ID, which could be based on the unique sample ID in your dataset (which can also be in recorded in materialSampleID). OBIS does not need to have separate eventIDs and materialSampleIDs, rather OBIS can treat these two terms as equivalent. The unique sample ID for each physical sample or subsample at each location and time is highly recommended information for sample tracebility and data provenance. Repeating the parentEventID in the child event (use : as delimiter) will make the structure of the dataset easier to understand. See also De Pooter et al. 2017 for an example of an event hierarchy in a complex benthos dataset. habitat is a category or description of the habitat in which the Event occurred (e.g. seamount, hydrothermal vent, seagrass, rocky shore, intertidal, ship wreck etc.) Example: | eventID | parentEventID | eventDate | eventRemarks | |-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|--------------| | IOF_benthos_Plominski_zaljev_2000_crs | | | cruise | | IOF_benthos_Plominski_zaljev_2000_stat1 | IOF_benthos_Plominski_zaljev_2000_crs | 2000-08 | stationVisit | | IOF_benthos_Plominski_zaljev_2000_stat2 | IOF_benthos_Plominski_zaljev_2000_crs | 2000-08 | stationVisit | | IOF_benthos_Plominski_zaljev_2000_s01 | IOF_benthos_Plominski_zaljev_2000_stat1 | | sample | | IOF_benthos_Plominski_zaljev_2000_s02 | IOF_benthos_Plominski_zaljev_2000_stat2 | | sample | Data from Environmental impact assessments in the eastern part of Adriatic sea - species list of benthic invertebrates and phytobenthos (2000-2010). 2.2.1.3.6 Time The date and time at which an occurrence was recorded goes in eventDate. This term uses the ISO 8601 standard. OBIS recommends using the extended ISO 8601 format with hyphens. ISO 8601 dates can represent moments in time at different resolutions, as well as time intervals, which use / as a separator. Date and time are separated by T. Times can have a time zone indicator at the end, if this is not the case then the time is assumed to be local time. When a time is UTC, a Z is added. Some examples of ISO 8601 dates are: 1973-02-28T15:25:00 2005-08-31T12:11+12 1993-01-26T04:39+12/1993-01-26T05:48+12 2008-04-25T09:53 1948-09-13 1993-01/02 1993-01 1993 Besides year, month and day numbers, ISO 8601 also supports ordinal dates (year and day number within that year) and week dates (year, week, and day number within that week). These dates are less common and have the formats YYYY-DDD (for example 2015-023) and YYYY-Www-D (for example 2014-W26-3). ISO 8601 durations should not be used. 2.2.1.3.7 Sampling Information on sampleSizeValue and sampleSizeUnit is very important when an organism quantity is specified. However, with OBIS-ENV-DATA it was felt that the extended MeasurementorFact (eMoF) extension would be better suited than the DwC Event Core to store the sampled area and/or volume because in some cases sampleSize by itself may not be detailed enough to allow interpretation of the sample. For instance, in the case of a plankton tow, the volume of water that passed through the net is relevant. In case of Niskin bottles, the volume of sieved water is more relevant than the actual volume in the bottle. In these examples, as well as generally when recording sampling effort for all protocols, eMoF enables greater flexibility to define parameters, as well as the ability to describe the entire sample and treatment protocol through multiple parameters. eMoF also allows you to standardize your terms to a controlled vocabulary. The next chapter deals with the metadata (description of the dataset) in Ecological Metadata Language. "],["eml.html", "", " 2.2.2 Ecological Metadata Language OBIS (and GBIF) uses the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) as its metadata standard, which is specifically developed for the earth, environmental and ecological sciences. It is based on prior work done by the Ecological Society of America and associated efforts. EML is implemented as XML. See more information on EML. OBIS uses the GBIF EML profile (version 1.1). In case data providers use ISO19115/ISO19139, there is a mapping available here. For OBIS, the following 4 terms are the bare minimum: Title, Citation, Contact and Abstract. Below is an overview of all the EML terms used to describe datasets: title [xml:lang=\"...\"]: A good descriptive title is indispensable and can provide the user with valuable information, making the discovery of data easier. Multiple titles may be provided, particularly when trying to express the title in more than one language (use the “xml:lang” attribute to indicate the language if not English/en). creator ; metadataProvider ; associatedParty ; contact : These are the people and organizations responsible for the dataset resource, either as the creator, the metadata provider, contact person or any other association. The following details can be provided: individualName givenName surName organizationName: Name of the institution. positionName: to be used as alternative to persons names (leave individualName blank and use positionName instead e.g. data manager). address deliveryPoint city administrativeArea postalCode country phone electronicMailAddress onlineUrl : personal website role: used with associatedParty to indicate the role of the associated person or organization. userID: e.g. ORCID. directory pubDate: The date that the resource was published.

This term is optional. 2.2.2.1 Scenarios 2.2.2.1.1 Title The IPT requires you to provide a Shortname. Shortnames serve as an identifier for the resource within the IPT installation (so should be unique within your IPT), and will be used as a parameter in the URL to access the resource via the Internet. Please use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, or underscores. E.g. largenet_im in http://ipt.vliz.be/eurobis/resource?r=largenet_im. After creating a new dataset resource, the field titel will be filled out with the short name you provided earlier. Please make sure you provide a dataset title following the guidelines below. Dataset titles provided to OBIS node managers are often very cryptic, such as an acronym, and often only understandable by the data provider. However, to increae the discoverability and be useful for a larger audience, the dataset title should be as descriptive and complete as possible. OBIS recommends titles to contain information about the taxonomic, geographic and temporal coverage. If the dataset title does not meet these criteria and you believe the title should be changed, then contact the data provider with a suggestion or ask for a more descriptive title. If the dataset has already been published (made publicly available) - and therefore known by that title elsewere, then the same title should be kept (even if it would not meet the proposed guidelines)! Changing the title of an already published dataset cannot be done, as this will generate confusion and possible duplicates in systems like OBIS or GBIF in a later stage. The acronym or working title could still be documented in the metadata, so there is no confusion about how the full title is linked to the originally provided acronym or working title. :exclamation: Always consult the data provider when changing a dataset title to a more workable and descriptive version. Originally received title Title Recommended by Node Manager ------------------------- --------------------------------- BIOCEAN BIOCEAN database on deep sea benthic fauna Biomôr Benthic data from the Southern Irish Sea from 1989-1991 Kyklades Zoobenthos of the Kyklades (Aegean Sea) REPHY Réseau de Surveillance phytoplanctonique 2.2.2.1.2 Abstract The abstract or description of a dataset provides basic information on the content of the dataset. The information in the abstract should improve understanding and interpretation of the data. It is recommended that the description indicates whether the dataset is a subset of a larger dataset and – if so – provide a link to the parent metadata and/or dataset. If the data provider or OBIS node require bi- or multilingual entries for the description (e.g. due to national obligations) then the following procedure can be followed: Indicate English as metadata language Enter the English description first Type a slash (/) Enter the description in the second language Example The Louis-Marie herbarium grants a priority to the Arctic-alpine, subarctic and boreal species from the province of Quebec and the northern hemisphere. This dataset is mainly populated with specimens from the province of Quebec. / L’Herbier Louis-Marie accorde une priorité aux espèces arctiques-alpines, subarctiques et boréales du Québec, du Canada et de l’hémisphère nord. Ce jeu présente principalement des spécimens provenant du Québec. 2.2.2.1.3 People and Organizations The EML has several possible roles/functions to describe a contact, creator, metadata provider and associated party. The contact is the person or organization that curates the resource and who should be contacted to get more information or to whom questions with the resource or data should be addressed. Although a number of fields are not required, we strongly recommend providing as much information as possible, and in particular the email address. This will also be the contact information that appears on the OBIS metadata pages. The creator is the person or organization responsible for the original creation of the resource content. When there are multiple creators, the one that bears the greatest responsibility is the resource creator, and other people can be added as associated parties with a role such as ‘originator’, ‘content provider’, ‘principle investigator’, etc. Possible functions/roles: Originator (person/organization that originally gathered/prepared the dataset) Content provider (principal person/organization that contributed content to the dataset) If the resource contact and the resource creator are identical, the IPT allows you to easily copy the information. The metadata provider is the person or organization responsible for producing the resource metadata. If the metadata are provided by the original data provider, then his/her contact details should be filled in. If no metadata are available (e.g. for historical datasets, with no contact person), then the metadata can be completed by e.g. the OBIS node manager and the OBIS node manager becomes the metadata provider. The Associated Parties contains information about one or more people or organizations associated with the resource in addition to those already covered on the IPT Basic Metadata page. For example, if there would be multiple contact persons or metadata creators, they can be added in this IPT section. The principle contact/creator should, however, be added in the IPT Basic Metadata section. It is recommended to complete this section together with the IPT Basic Metadata page, to avoid confusion or overlap in added information. Possible functions/roles for associated parties are: Custodian steward (person/organization responsible for/takes care of the dataset paper) Owner (person/organization that owns the data – may or may not be the custodian) Point of contact (person/organization to contact for further information on the dataset) Principle investigator (primary scientific contact associated with the dataset) Notes The owner of a dataset will, in most cases, be an institute, and not an individual person. Although the fields ‘last name’, and ‘position’ are indicated as mandatory fields, it is possible to just add the institute name in the ‘last name’ field for the role ‘owner’. The contact persons in the metadata (contact, creator, metadata creator) are used in the dataset citation (auto-generation) and those added as ‘associated parties’ are not included as “co-authors”. 2.2.2.1.4 License and IP Rights OBIS has published its guidelines on the sharing and use of data here. The recommended licenses for datasets published in OBIS are the Creative Commons Licenses (CC-0, CC-BY, CC-BY-NC), of which CC-0 is the most preferred at CC-BY-NC is least preferred. A Creative Commons license means: You are free: to share =&gt; to copy, distribute and use the database to create =&gt; to produce works from the database to adapt =&gt; to modify, transform and build upon the database In case of CC-0: public domain: CC-0 is the preferred option identified by the OBIS steering group. You waive any copyright you might have over the data(set) and dedicate it to the public domain. You cannot be held liable for any (mis)use of the data either. Although CC-0 doesn’t legally require users of the data to cite the source, it does not take away the moral responsibility to give attribution, as is common in scientific research. A good blog on why using CC-0 can be found here. In case of CC-BY: Attribution: You must attribute any public use of the database, or works produced from the database, in the manner specified in the license. For any use or redistribution of the database, or works produced from it, you must make clear to others the license of the database and keep intact any notices on the original database. In case of CC-BY-NC: non-commercial: like CC-BY but commericial use is not allowed. This licence can be problematic when the data is re-used in scientific journals. 2.2.2.1.5 Coverage 2.2.2.1.5.1 Geographic Coverage The IPT allows you to enter the geographic coverage by dragging the markers on the given map or by filling in the coordinates of the bounding box. In the description field, a more elaborate text can be provided to describe the spatial coverage indicating the larger geographical area where the samples were collected. For the latter, the sampling locations can be plotted on a map and – by making use of a Gazetteer – the wider geographical area can be derived: e.g. the relevant Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), IHO, FAO fishing area, Large Marine Ecosystem (LME), Marine Ecoregions of the World (MEOW), etc. The Marine Regions’ Gazetteer might prove to be a useful online tool to define the most relevant sea area(s). There are also LifeWatch Geographical Services that translate geographical positions to these wider geographical areas. The information given in this section can also help the OBIS node manager in geographic quality control. If the geographic coverage in the EML e.g. is “North Sea”, but a number of data points are outside of this scope, then this may indicate errors, and should be checked with the data provider. If the dataset covers multiple areas (e.g. samples from the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea), then this should clearly be mentioned in the geographicDescription field. Note that the IPT only allows one bounding box. 2.2.2.1.5.2 Taxonomic Coverage This section can capture two things: A description of the range of taxa that are addressed in the data set. OBIS recommends to only add the higher classification (Kingdom, Class or Order) of the involved groups (e.g. Bivalvia, Cetacea, Aves, Ophiuroidea…). You can easily draw a list of higher taxonomic ranks from the WoRMS taxon match service (or ask the data provider). The taxonomic coverage is not a mandatory field, but the information stored here can be very useful as background information. The description can also contain common names, such as e.g. benthic foraminifera or mussels. An overview of all the involved taxa (not recommended, as all the taxa are already listed in the dataset). Note OBIS also recommends to add information on the (higher) taxonomic groups in the (descriptive) dataset title and abstract. 2.2.2.1.5.3 Temporal Coverage The temporal coverage will be a date range, which can easily be documented. If it is a single date, the start and end date will be the same. The information added here can be used as a quality check for the actual dates in the datasets. 2.2.2.1.6 Keywords Relevant keywords facilitate the discovery of a dataset. An indication of the represented functional groups can help in a general search (e.g. plankton, benthos, zooplankton, phytoplankton, macrobenthos, meiobenthos …). Assigned keywords can be related to taxonomy, habitat, geography or relevant keywords extracted from thesauri such as the ASFA thesaurus, the CAB thesaurus or GCMD keywords. As taxonomy and geography are already covered in previous sections, there is no need to repeat related keywords here. Please consult your data provider which (relevant) keywords can be assigned. 2.2.2.1.7 Project If the dataset in this resource is produced under a certain project, the metadata on this project can be documented here. Part of the information entered here, can partly overlap with information given in other sections of the metadata (e.g. study area description can have lot of parallel with the geographic coverage section). This is not a problem. 2.2.2.1.8 Sampling Methods The EML can contains descriptions of the sampling and data processing methods. Note that OBIS best practice is to add sampling facts to the extended MeasurementorFact extension, linked to the sampling events in the EventCore. 2.2.2.1.9 Citations The dataset citation allows users to properly cite the datasets in further publications or other uses of the data. The OBIS download function provides a list of the dataset citations packaged with the data in a zipped file. A dataset citation is different from the data source citation (in case the data is digitized from a publication), and these references can be added to the additional metadata (see bibliography below). A dataset citation can have the same format of a journal article citaiton, and should include the authors (contact, creator, principle investigator, data managers, custodians, collectors…), the title of the dataset, the name of the data publisher (or custodian institute), and the access point URL to the resource. GBIF’s IPT has an auto-generation - Turn On/Off - tool to let the IPT auto-generate the resource citation for you. The citation includes a version number, which is especially important for datasets that are continuously updated. The dataset citation can also include a Citation Identifier - a DOI, URI, or other persistent identifier that resolves to an online dataset web page. The OBIS node data managers should try to implement a certain degree of format standardization for the dataset citations. The IPT provides an option to auto-generate a citation based on the EML and is formatted as follows: {dataset.authors} ({dataset.pubDate}) {dataset.title}. [Version {dataset.version}]. {organization.title}. {dataset.type} Dataset {dataset.doi}, {dataset.url} 2.2.2.1.10 Bibliography The EML can include the citation of the publications that are related to the described dataset. They can describe the dataset, be based on the dataset or be used in this dataset. Publications can be scientific papers, reports, PhD or master theses. If available, the citation should include the DOI at the end. This overview will contribute to a better understanding of the data as these publications can hold important additional information on the data and how they were acquired. 2.2.2.1.11 Collection Data This IPT section should only be filled out if there are specimens held in a museum. If relevant, it is strongly recommended that this information is supplied by the data provider or left blank. 2.2.2.1.12 External Links This section can include URLs to the resource homepage, to download or find additional information. Links to the online dataset on the OBIS website can be added once the data is available there. For these OBIS links, the required fields should be completed as follows: Name: online dataset Character set: UTF-8 Data format: html If other links are added, then the data format for web-based data is ‘html’. If the link refers to a file, the data format of the file will need to be added (e.g. .xlsx, .pdf …). The character set for all Darwin Core files is UTF-8, whereas for other web pages this can vary. 2.2.2.1.13 Additional Metadata Any remaining information that could not be catalogued under any of the other metadata, can be mentioned here. "],["data_format.html", "", " 2.2.3 Darwin Core Archive and dataset structure Contents Darwin Core Archive OBIS holds more than just species occurrences: the ENV-DATA approach ExtendedMeasurementOrFact Extension (eMoF) MeasurementOrFact vocabularies eDNA &amp; DNA derived data Extension A special case: habitat types When to use Event Core When to use Occurrence Core Recommended reading 2.2.3.1 Darwin Core Archive Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) is the standard for packaging and publishing biodiversity data using Darwin Core terms. It is the preferred format for publishing data in OBIS and GBIF. The format is described in the Darwin Core text guide. A Darwin Core Archive contains a number of text files, including data tables formatted as CSV. The conceptual data model of the Darwin Core Archive is a star schema with a single core table, for example containing occurrence records or event records, at the center of the star. Extension tables can optionally be associated with the core table. It is not possible to link extension tables to other extension tables (to form a so-called snowflake schema). There is a one-to-many relationship between the core and extension records, so each core record can have zero or more extension records linked to it, and each extension record must be linked to exactly one core record. Definitions for the core and extension tables can be found here. Besides data tables, a Darwin Core Archive also contains two XML files: one file which describes the archive and data file structure (meta.xml), and one file which contains the dataset’s metadata (eml.xml). Figure: structure of a Darwin Core Archive. 2.2.3.2 OBIS holds more than just species occurrences: the ENV-DATA approach Data collected as part of marine biological research often include measurements of habitat features (such as physical and chemical parameters of the environment), biotic and biometric measurements (such as body size, abundance, biomass), as wel as details regarding the nature of the sampling or observation methods, equipment, and sampling effort. In the past, OBIS relied solely on the Occurrence Core, and additional measurements were added in a structured format (e.g. JSON) in the Darwin Core term dynamicProperties inside the occurrence records. This approach had significant downsides: the format is difficult to construct and deconstruct, there is no standardization of terms, and attributes which are shared by multiple records (think sampling methodology) have to be repeated many times. The formatting problem can be addressed by moving measurements to a MeasurementOrFacts extension table, but that doesn’t solve the redundancy and standardization problems. With the release and adoption of a new core type Event Core it became possible to associate measurements with nested events (such as cruises, stations, and samples), but the restrictive star schema of Darwin Core archive prohibited associating measurements with the event records in the Event core as well as with the occurrence records in the Occurrence extension. For this reason an extended version of the existing MeasurementOrFact extension was created. 2.2.3.2.1 ExtendedMeasurementOrFact Extension (eMoF) As part of the IODE pilot project Expanding OBIS with environmental data OBIS-ENV-DATA, OBIS introduced a custom ExtendedMeasurementOrFact or eMoF extension, which extends the existing MeasurementOrFact extension with 4 new terms: occurrenceID measurementTypeID measurementValueID measurementUnitID The occurrenceID term is used to circumvent the limitations of the star schema, and link measurement records in the ExtendedMeasurementOrFact extension to occurrence records in the Occurrence extension. Note that in order to comply with the Darwin Core Archive standard, these records still need to link to an event record in the Event core table as well. Thanks to this term we can now store a variety of measurements and facts linked to either events or occurrences: organism quantifications (e.g. counts, abundance, biomass, % live cover, etc.) species biometrics (e.g. body length, weight, etc.) facts documenting a specimen (e.g. living/dead, behaviour, invasiveness, etc.) abiotic measurements (e.g. temperature, salinity, oxygen, sediment grain size, habitat features) facts documenting the sampling activity (e.g. sampling device, sampled area, sampled volume, sieve mesh size). Figure: Overview of an OBIS-ENV-DATA format. Sampling parameters, abiotic measurements, and occurrences are linked to events using the eventID (full lines). Biotic measurements are linked to occurrences using the new occurrenceID field of the ExtendedMeasurementOrFact Extension (dashed lines). 2.2.3.2.2 MeasurementOrFact vocabularies The MeasurementOrFact terms measurementType, measurementValue and measurementUnit are completely unconstrained and can be populated with free text annotation. While free text offers the advantage of capturing complex and as yet unclassified information, the inevitable semantic heterogeneity (e.g. of spelling or wording) becomes a major challenge for effective data integration and analysis. Hence, OBIS added 3 new terms: measurementTypeID, measurementValueID and measurementUnitID to standardise the measurement types, values and units. Note that measurementValueID is not used for standardizing numeric measurements. The three new terms should be populated using controlled vocabularies referenced using Unique Resource Identifiers (URIs). OBIS recommends to use the internationally recognized NERC Vocabulary Server, developed by the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC), which can be searched through https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/vocabularies/vocabulary_search/. The following vocabularies are recommended for populating measurementTypeID, measurementValueID, and measurementUnitID: 2.2.3.2.2.1 measurementTypeID BODC Parameter Usage Vocabulary (P01) documentation: https://github.com/nvs-vocabs/P01 vocabulary: http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/ search: https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/vocabularies/vocabulary_search/P01/ OBIS sampling instruments and methods attributes (Q01) vocabulary: http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/Q01/current/ search: https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/vocabularies/vocabulary_search/Q01/ 2.2.3.2.2.2 measurementValueID Sampling instruments and sensors (SeaVoX Device Catalogue) documentation: https://github.com/nvs-vocabs/L22 vocabulary: http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current search: https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/vocabularies/vocabulary_search/L22/ Sampling instrument categories (SeaDataNet device categories) documentation: https://github.com/nvs-vocabs/L05 vocabulary: http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L05/current search: https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/vocabularies/vocabulary_search/L05/ Vessels (ICES Platform Codes) vocabulary: http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/C17/current search: https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/vocabularies/vocabulary_search/C17/ Sex (Gender) documentation: https://github.com/nvs-vocabs/S10 vocabulary: http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/S10/current/ search: https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/vocabularies/vocabulary_search/S10/ Lifestage documentation: https://github.com/nvs-vocabs/S11 vocabulary: http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/S11/current/ search: https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/vocabularies/vocabulary_search/S11/ Papers or manuals on the sampling protocol used DOI Handle for publications on IOC’s Ocean Best Practices repository, for example: http://hdl.handle.net/11329/304 2.2.3.2.2.3 MeasurementUnitID Units documentation: https://github.com/nvs-vocabs/P06 vocabulary: http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current search: https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/vocabularies/vocabulary_search/P06/ 2.2.3.2.3 eDNA &amp; DNA derived data Extension DNA derived data are increasingly being used to document taxon occurrences. To ensure these data are useful to the broadest possible community, GBIF published a guide entitled Publishing DNA-derived data through biodiversity data platforms. This guide is supported by the DNA derived data extension for Darwin Core, which incorporates MIxS terms into the Darwin Core standard. eDNA and DNA derived data is linked to occurrence data with the use of occurrenceID and/ or eventID. Refer to the Examples: ENV-DATA and DNA derived data for use case examples of eDNA and DNA derived data. 2.2.3.2.4 A special case: habitat types Event Core is perfect for enriching OBIS with interpreted information such as biological community, biotope or habitat type (collectively referred to as ‘habitats’). However, the unconstrained nature of the terms measurementTypeID, measurementValueID, and measurementUnitID leads to a risk that habitats measurements are structured inconsistently within the Darwin Core Archive standard and as a result, are not easily discoverable, understood or usable. As a result, members of the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) Seabed Habitats and Biology thematic groups have produced a document Duncan et al. (2021) that recommends a consistent approach to structuring classified habitat data in Europe using the Darwin Core eMoF Extension. Note that this approach has not yet been discussed or approved at the global level so the implementation at the EurOBIS level may be considered a pilot. The overarching principles are summarised here. Note that because of the numerous classification systems and priority habitat lists in existence, it is not possible to point to a single vocabulary for populating each of measurementTypeID, measurementValueID and measurementUnitID, as for other measurement types, so below are the types of information to include, with an example, as recommended by Duncan et al. (2021): measurementTypeID: A machine-readable URI or DOI reference describing the (version of the) classification system itself. For example: https://dd.eionet.europa.eu/vocabulary/biodiversity/eunishabitats/ measurementValueID: If available, a machine-readable URI describing the habitat class in “measurementValue”. For example: https://dd.eionet.europa.eu/vocabulary/biodiversity/eunishabitats/A5.36 measurementUnitID: null because habitat types are unitless. Please consult Duncan et al. (2021) for more details, including: - how to handle a single event with multiple habitat measurements - recommended vocabularies and terms for common habitat classification systems - example eMoF table 2.2.3.2.5 When to use Event Core When the dataset contains abiotic measurements, or other biological measurements which are related to an entire sample (not a single specimen) When specific details are known about how a biological sample was taken and processed. These details can be expressed using the eMoF and the newly developed Q01 vocabulary. Event Core should be used in combination with the Occurrence Extension and the eMoF. 2.2.3.2.6 When to use Occurrence Core No information on how the data was sampled or samples were processed. No abiotic measurements are taken or provided Biological measurements are made on individual specimens (each specimen is a single occurrence record) This is often the case for museum collections, citations of occurrences from literature, individual sightings. Datasets formatted in Occurrence Core can use the eMoF Extension for biotic measurements or facts. 2.2.3.2.7 Recommended reading De Pooter et al. 2017.

Note: for the purposes of this section, only required Occurrence core terms are shown, in addition to all eDNA &amp; DNA specific terms. For additional Occurrence core terms, refer to Occurrence. 2.2.4.1.1 eDNA data from Monterey Bay, California The data for this example is from the use case “18S Monterey Bay Time Series: an eDNA data set from Monterey Bay, California, including years 2006, 2013 - 2016’. The data from this study originate from marine filtered seawater samples that have undergone metabarcoding of the 18S V9 region. Occurrence core: We can populate the Occurrence core with all the required and highly recommended fields, as well as considering the eDNA and DNA specific fields. The Occurrence core contain the taxonomic identification of each ASV observed; its number of reads, as well as relevant metadata including the sample collection location, references for the identification procedure, and links to archived sequences. OccurrenceID and basisOfRecord are some of the required Occurrence core terms, in addition to the highly recommended fields of organismQuantity and organismQuantityType. A selection of samples from this plate were included in another publication (Djurhuus et al., 2020),which is recorded in identificationReferences along with the GitHub repository where the data can be found. occurrenceID basisOfRecord organismQuantity OrganismQuantityType associatedSequences 11216c01_12_edna_1_S_occ1 MaterialSample 19312 DNA sequence reads NCBI BioProject acc. nr.

This extension contains the DNA sequences and relevant DNA metadata, including sequencing procedures, primers used and SOP’s. The recommended use of ENVO’s biome classes were applied to describe the environmental system from which the sample was extracted. The samples were collected by CTD rosette and filtered by a peristaltic pump system. Illumina MiSeq metabarcoding was applied for the target_gene 18S and the target_subfragment, V9 region. URL’s are provided for the protocols followed for nucleic acids extraction and amplification. For a detailed description of the steps taken to process the data, including algorithms used, see the original publication.

In this example, environmental measurements were provided in an eMoF file, in addition to the DNA derived data and occurrence data. Here we show how to incorporate such measurements in the extensions. In the publication “Diversity of Pico- to Mesoplankton along the 2000 km Salinity Gradient of the Baltic Sea”, a dataset with 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding data of surface water microbial communities was created from 21 off-shore stations, following a transect from Kattegat to the Gulf of Bothnia in the Baltic Sea. The full dataset entitled “Diversity of Pico- to Mesoplankton along the 2000 km Salinity Gradient of the Baltic Sea (Hu et al. 2016) is available from GBIF. Occurrence core: The Occurrence core contain information about the organisms in the sample including the taxonomy and quantity of organisms detected, the collection location, references for the identification procedure, and links to the sequences generated. Important note: even though this dataset uses OTU identifiers for taxonomy (therefore not including scientificNameID) OBIS still recommends using scientificNameID. basisOfRecord occurrenceID eventID eventDate MaterialSample SBDI-ASV-3:16S_1:919a2aa9d306e4cf3fa9ca02a2aa5730 SBDI-ASV-3:16S_1 2013-07-13 07:08:00 MaterialSample SBDI-ASV-3:16S_1:43e088977eba5732bfa45e20b1d8cdd2 SBDI-ASV-3:16S_1 2013-07-13 07:08:00 MaterialSample SBDI-ASV-3:16S_1:887bc7033b46d960e893caceb711700b SBDI-ASV-3:16S_1 2013-07-13 07:08:00 organismQuantity organismQuantityType sampleSizeValue sampleSizeUnit 2235 DNA sequence reads 12393 DNA sequence reads 795 DNA sequence reads 12393 DNA sequence reads 40 DNA sequence reads 12393 DNA sequence reads samplingProtocol associatedSequences identificationReferences identificationRemarks 200–500 mL seawater were filtered onto 0.22 μm pore-size mixed cellulose ester membrane filters; [https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00679] [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR1202034] [https://docs.biodiversitydata.se/analyse-data/molecular-tools/#taxonomy-annotation] DADA2:assignTaxonomy:addSpecies annotation against sbdi-gtdb=R06-RS202-1; confidence at lowest specified (ASV portal) taxon: 0.5 200–500 mL seawater were filtered onto 0.22 μm pore-size mixed cellulose ester membrane filters; [https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00679] [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR1202034] [https://docs.biodiversitydata.se/analyse-data/molecular-tools/#taxonomy-annotation] DADA2:assignTaxonomy:addSpecies annotation against sbdi-gtdb=R06-RS202-1; confidence at lowest specified (ASV portal) taxon: 0.56 200–500 mL seawater were filtered onto 0.22 μm pore-size mixed cellulose ester membrane filters; [https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00679] [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR1202034] [https://docs.biodiversitydata.se/analyse-data/molecular-tools/#taxonomy-annotation] DADA2:assignTaxonomy:addSpecies annotation against sbdi-gtdb=R06-RS202-1; confidence at lowest specified (ASV portal) taxon: 0.99 decimalLatitude decimalLongitude taxonID scientificName 55.185 13.791 ASV:919a2aa9d306e4cf3fa9ca02a2aa5730 UBA6821 55.185 13.791 ASV:43e088977eba5732bfa45e20b1d8cdd2 Chthoniobacterales 55.185 13.791 ASV:887bc7033b46d960e893caceb711700b BACL27 sp014190055 kingdom phylum class order family genus Bacteria Verrucomicrobiota Verrucomicrobiae Chthoniobacterales UBA6821 UBA6821 Bacteria Verrucomicrobiota Verrucomicrobiae Chthoniobacterales NA NA Bacteria Actinobacteriota Acidimicrobiia Acidimicrobiales Ilumatobacteraceae BACL27 DNA Derived Data extension: The DNA Derived Data extension for metabarcoding data contains the DNA sequences and relevant DNA metadata, primers and procedures.

Figure: A fictional macroalgae survey with a single site, multiple zones, quadrats, and different types of transects. Event core: First we can create the Event core table by extracting all events in a broad sense and populating attributes such as time, location, and depth at the appropriate level. The events at the different levels are linked together using eventID and parentEventID. As the survey sites has a fixed location we can populate decimalLongitude and decimalLatitude at the top level event. The zones have different depths, so minimumDepthInMeters and maximumDepthInMeters are populated at the zone level. Finally, as not all sampling was done on the same day, eventDate is populated at the quadrat and transect level. eventID parentEventID eventDate decimalLongitude decimalLatitude minimumDepthInMeters maximumDepthInMeters site_1 54.7943 16.9425 zone_1 site_1 0 0 zone_2 site_1 0 5 zone_3 site_1 5 10 quadrat_1 zone_1 2019-01-02 transect_1 zone_2 2019-01-03 transect_2 zone_3 2019-01-04 Occurrence extension: Next we can construct the Occurrence extension table. This table has the scientific names and links to the World Register of Marine Species in scientificNameID. The first column of the table references the events in the core table (see quadrat_1 for example highlighted in green). id occurrenceID scientificName scientificNameID quadrat_1 occ_1 Ulva rigida urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:145990 quadrat_1 occ_2 Ulva lactuca urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:145984 transect_1 occ_3 Plantae urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:3 transect_1 occ_4 Plantae urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:3 transect_2 occ_5 Gracilaria urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:144188 transect_2 occ_6 Laurencia urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:143914 extendedMeasurementOrFact (eMoF) extension: And finally there is the MeasurementOrFact extension table, which has attributes of the zones (shore height), the quadrats (surface area), the transects (surface area and length), and the occurrences (percentage cover and functional group). Attributes of occurrences point to the Occurrence extension table using the occurrenceID column (see occ_1 and occ_2 highlighted in blue and orange). Note that besides NERC vocabulary terms we are also referencing the CATAMI vocabulary for macroalgal functional groups. id occurrenceID measurementType measurementTypeID measurementValue measurementValueID measurementUnit measurementUnitID zone_1 shore height ? high ? quadrat_1 surface area P01/current/AREABEDS 0.25 m2 P06/current/UMSQ quadrat_1 occ_1 cover P01/current/SDBIOL10 24 percent P06/current/UPCT quadrat_1 occ_2 cover P01/current/SDBIOL10 56 percent P06/current/UPCT transect_1 surface area P01/current/AREABEDS 60 m2 P06/current/UMSQ transect_1 length P01/current/LENTRACK 30 m P06/current/ULAA transect_1 occ_3 functional group ? sheet-like red CATAMI:80300925 transect_1 occ_4 functional group ? filamentous brown CATAMI:80300931 transect_1 occ_3 cover P01/current/SDBIOL10 8 percent P06/current/UPCT transect_1 occ_4 cover P01/current/SDBIOL10 24 percent P06/current/UPCT transect_2 occ_5 cover P01/current/SDBIOL10 4 percent P06/current/UPCT transect_2 occ_6 cover P01/current/SDBIOL10 16 percent P06/current/UPCT 2.2.4.6 Mangroves cover &amp; composition (example coming soon)   2.2.4.7 Marine birds abundance &amp; distribution The example for ENV-DATA collected with marine bird sightings/occurrences is based on the dataset “RV Investigator Voyage IN2017_V02 Seabird Observations, Australia (2017)”. In this dataset, seabird sightings were recorded continuously during daylight hours during a voyage to recover and redeploy moorings at the SOTS site, southwest of Tasmania, Australia, in March 2017. Observations were made from c.30 minutes before sunrise to c.30 minutes after sunset, extending to 300m in the forward quadrant with the best viewing conditions. There were 1200 observations from 38 species of birds along with 3 cetacean species and one seal. This example will focus on the ENV-DATA associated with the bird sightings. The most frequently sighted bird species were Puﬃnus tenuirostris (Short-tailed Shearwater) and Pachyptila turtur (Fairy Prion). For this dataset, human observation recorded individual bird sightings (thus, each specimen is a single occurrence). The dataset contains abiotic measurements (ENV-DATA) which are related to each individual sighting, instead of an entire sample. Therefore, we can create an Occurrence core with an eMoF extension that contain the abiotic environmental measurements or facts. Occurrence core: The Occurrence core is populated with the occurrence records of seabirds sighted during the RV voyages. Occurrence details and scientific names are provided here. All birds were observed above sea level, all minimumDepthInMeters and maximumDepthInMeters values equal zero. occurrenceID eventDate institutionCode collectionCode in2017_v02_00998 2017-03-17 01:07:00 Australasian Seabird Group, BirdLife Australia in2017_v02_wov in2017_v02_01380 2017-03-19 22:26:00 Australasian Seabird Group, BirdLife Australia in2017_v02_wov in2017_v02_01012 2017-03-17 02:38:00 Australasian Seabird Group, BirdLife Australia in2017_v02_wov basisOfRecord recordedBy organismQuantity organismQuantityType occurrenceStatus HumanObservation EJW+CRC+TAH 2 individuals present HumanObservation EJW+CRC+TAH 1 individuals present HumanObservation EJW+CRC+TAH 1 individuals present decimalLatitude decimalLongitude coordinateUncertaintyInMeters coordinatePrecision footprintWKT -43.40741 147.45576 200 0.0018 POINT (147.45576 -43.40741) -45.98644 142.1445 200 0.0018 POINT (142.14450 -45.98644) -43.40728 147.45549 200 0.0018 POINT (147.45549 -43.40728) scientificNameID scientificName scientificNameAuthorship vernacularName urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:343991 Morus serrator (Gray,1843) Australasian Gannet urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:212648 Pachyptila turtur (Kuhl,1820) Fairy Prion urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:707545 Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae Stephens,1826 Silver Gull extendedMeasurementOrFact (eMoF) extension: As shown in previous examples, the MeasurementOrFact extension table contains abiotic measurements or facts corresponding to an occurrence / sighting. Individual sightings and abiotic measurements are linked with occurrenceID. In the example dataset, the ENV-DATA consist of measurements taken during the moorings deployment at the SOTS site, at the time of the marine bird sightings. In addition to NERC vocabulary terms, authors also referenced the Australian Ocean Data Network (AODN) Discovery Parameter Vocabulary for Sea-floor depth (m) and Sea Surface Temperature as measurementType. NERC equivalents to the AODN terms are added as additional MeasurementOrFact (MoF) records. occurrenceID measurementID measurementType measurementTypeID in2017_v02_00998 in2017_v02_00998-depth Sea-floor depth (m) http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/discovery_parameter/entity/574 in2017_v02_00998 in2017_v02_00998-depth Sea-floor depth http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/MBANZZZZ/ in2017_v02_00998 in2017_v02_00998-air_pressure Air Pressure (hPa) http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/CAPHZZ01 in2017_v02_00998 in2017_v02_00998-air_temp Atmospheric temperature (deg C) http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/CTMPZZ01 in2017_v02_00998 in2017_v02_00998-wov_sea_state Sea state http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/C39/current/ in2017_v02_00998 in2017_v02_00998-sea_surface_temp Sea surface temperature http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/discovery_parameter/entity/97 in2017_v02_00998 in2017_v02_00998-sea_surface_temp Sea surface temperature http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/standard_name/sea_surface_temperature/ in2017_v02_00998 in2017_v02_00998-wind_direction Wind direction (deg) http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/EWDAZZ01 in2017_v02_00998 in2017_v02_00998-wind_speed Wind Speed (knt) http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/ESSAZZ01 measurementValue measurementValueID measurementUnit measurementUnitID 73.0313 NA Metres http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current/ULAA 73.0313 NA Metres http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current/ULAA 1024.91385 NA hPa http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current/HPAX 15.3 NA degrees Celsius http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current/UPAA moderate 1.25 - 2.5 m http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/C39/current/4/ 17.32 NA degrees Celsius http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current/UPAA 17.32 NA degrees Celsius http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current/UPAA 283 NA degrees http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current/UABB 5.49 NA Knots (nautical miles per hour) http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current/UKNT 2.2.4.8 Marine mammals abundance &amp; distribution In this section we will explore how to encode a survey data set into Darwin Core using the ENV-DATA approach. As an example, sections of the actual data set of CETUS: Cetacean monitoring surveys in the Eastern North Atlantic, is used. Figure: A representation of the observation events of CETUS: Cetacean monitoring surveys in the Eastern North Atlantic, presenting the route Madeira as a site with three cruises (zones). Each Cruise is divided into different Transects and each transect contains a number of Positions. Event core: Create the Event core table by extracting all events and populating attributes. As in the previous example, the events at the different levels are linked together using eventID and parentEventID. As the survey observations were made at locations of cetacean sightings instead of fixed locations, we can populate footprintWKT and footprintSRS as location information. Not all sampling was done on the same day, therefore eventDate is populated at the transect level. eventID parentEventID eventDate footprintWKT footprintSRS Madeira 2012-07/2017-09 POLYGON ((-16.74 31.49, -16.74 41.23, -8.70 41.23, -8.70 31.49, -16.74 31.49)) EPSG:4326 Madeira:Cruise-001 Madeira 2012-07 MULTIPOINT ( (-8.7 41.19), (-9.15 38.7)) EPSG:4326 Madeira:Cruise-002 Madeira 2012-07 MULTIPOINT ( (-9.15 38.7), (-16.73 32.74)) EPSG:4326 Madeira:Cruise-003 Madeira 2012-07 MULTIPOINT ( (-16.73 32.74), (-9.15 38.7)) EPSG:4326 Occurrence extension: Construct the Occurrence extension table with the scientific names and links to the World Register of Marine Species in scientificNameID.

Extracts from the actual data set of Presence of sea turtles collected through Fixed-Line-Transect monitoring across the Western Mediterranean Sea (Civitavecchia-Barcelona route) between 2013 and 2017, are used as an example. Event core: The Event core is created by extracting all sighting events and populating the attributes at each event. The events at the different levels are linked together using eventID and parentEventID. In the example dataset, turtle sightings have been recorded since 2007, along a ferry route between Italy and Spain, as part of the monitoring project FLT Med Net (Fixed Line Transect Mediterranean monitoring Network). Turtle sighting locations can be given by populating the fields footprintWKT and footprintSRS with location information. Sightings were recorded at different dates, therefore eventDate is populated at the transect level. id modified datasetID datasetName TURTLE_CBAR_0043 2021-05-05 07:59:08 https://marineinfo.org/id/dataset/6403 Presence of sea turtles collected through Fixed-Line-Transect monitoring across the Western Mediterranean Sea TURTLE_CBAR_0045 2021-05-05 07:59:08 https://marineinfo.org/id/dataset/6403 Presence of sea turtles collected through Fixed-Line-Transect monitoring across the Western Mediterranean Sea TURTLE_CBAR_0045_0001 2021-05-05 07:59:08 https://marineinfo.org/id/dataset/6403 Presence of sea turtles collected through Fixed-Line-Transect monitoring across the Western Mediterranean Sea TURTLE_CBAR_0045_0002 2021-05-05 07:59:08 https://marineinfo.org/id/dataset/6403 Presence of sea turtles collected through Fixed-Line-Transect monitoring across the Western Mediterranean Sea eventID parentEventID eventDate TURTLE_CBAR_0043 2013-04-03T05:30:00+02:00/2013-04-03T16:00:00+02:00 TURTLE_CBAR_0045 2013-04-18T05:22:00+02:00/2013-04-18T15:53:00+02:00 TURTLE_CBAR_0045_0001 TURTLE_CBAR_0045 2013-04-18T05:55:00+02:00 TURTLE_CBAR_0045_0002 TURTLE_CBAR_0045 2013-04-18T08:35:00+02:00 eventRemarks minimumDepthInMeters maximumDepthInMeters decimalLatitude decimalLongitude transect 0 0 41.26179967 4.933265167 transect 0 0 41.30371367 4.936571167 sample 0 0 41.3228 7.4984 sample 0 0 41.322845 5.995345 geodeticDatum coordinateUncertaintyInMeters footprintWKT footprintSRS EPSG:4326 222970.2874 LINESTRING (7.602633333333 41.24378333333, 2.263897 41.279816) EPSG:4326 EPSG:4326 225420.0359 LINESTRING (7.636983333333 41.32418333333, 2.236159 41.283244) EPSG:4326 EPSG:4326 POINT EPSG:4326 EPSG:4326 POINT EPSG:4326 Occurrence extension: The Occurrence extension contain details regarding the sighted animals and include scientificName and the links to the World Register of Marine Species in scientificNameID.

We acknowledge the work that the C-grass SCOR work group has done to develop a proposed scheme for completing Seagrass related extension files. Here encode seagrass survey data into Darwin Core according to the ENV-DATA approach and using sections of the actual data set of Seagrass Monitoring at Chengue Bay, Colombia as an example dataset. Event core: The Event core table is created by extracting all events and attributes. All events are linked together using eventID and parentEventID. eventDate is populated at the transect level with the recommended format that conforms to ISO 8601-1:2019. habitat is populated as a category or description of the habitat in which the event occurred. Additional fieldNotes can also be provided if applicable. The recommended best practice for countryCode is to use an ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 country code. The remaining Event core fields comprise of location data including maximumDepthInMeters, minimumDepthInMeters, decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude, coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, footprintWKT and footprintSRS. Addtionally in the Event core, it is recommended to further include information regarding license, rightsHolder, bibliographicCitation, institutionID, datasetID, institutionCode and datasetName. eventID parentEventID eventDate habitat fieldNotes countryCode USBsg-chengue-pastocoral 2019-05-13 seagrass no notes CO USBsg-chengue-pastomanglar 2019-05-14 seagrass no notes CO USBsg-chengue-pastocoral-SquidPopTransect1 USBsg-chengue-pastocoral 2019-05-13 seagrass no notes CO USBsg-chengue-pastocoral-SquidPopTransect2 USBsg-chengue-pastocoral 2019-05-13 seagrass no notes CO minimumDepthInMeters maximumDepthInMeters decimalLatitude decimalLongitude coordinateUncertaintyInMeters footprintWKT footprintSRS 0.8 2 11.32021806 -74.12753684 10 POLYGON ((-74.1273259763024 11.320475512862,-74.1272978004008 11.3201655779439)) EPSG:4326 0.8 0.8 11.31977189 -74.12536879 10 POLYGON ((-74.1253370891273 11.3195001294432,-74.1253337743154 11.3194968146313)) EPSG:4326 0.8 2 11.32039927 -74.12737404 50 POINT (-74.1273740410759 11.3203992721869) EPSG:4326 0.8 2 11.32027662 -74.1273989 50 POINT (-74.1273989021655 11.3202766241445) EPSG:4326 Occurrence extension: The Occurrence extension table contain data for each occurrence with an occurrenceID and is linked to the Event core with the eventID.

For example, all species names need to be matched against an authoritative taxonomic register, such as the World Register of Marine Species. In addition, quality is checked against the OBIS required fields as well as against any impossible values. OBIS checks, rejects and reports the data quality back to the OBIS nodes, but never change records. The OBIS tier 2 nodes are responsible for the data quality and communicate errors back to the data providers. A number of QC tools are developed to help data providers and OBIS nodes: QC tool for species names QC tool for geography and data format "],["name_matching.html", "", " 3.0.1 Name Matching Strategy for taxonomic quality control Three authoritative taxonomic lists are currently used in OBIS: the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), and the Catalogue of Life (CoL). The Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) is used to distinguish marine from freshwater species.  The OBIS node managers agreed to match all the scientific names in their datasets according to the following Name Matching workflow. 3.0.1.1 Step 1: Match with WoRMS The taxon match tool of the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) is available at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=match. The WoRMS taxon match will compare your taxon list to the taxa available in WoRMS. This taxon match takes into account exact matches and fuzzy matches, the latter being possible spelling variations of a name available in WoRMS. WoRMS also identifies ambiguous matches, indicating that several matching options are available. The user can check these ambiguous matches and select the correct one, based on e.g. the general group information (a sponge dataset) or the authority. If this would be impossible with the available information (e.g. missing authority or very diverse dataset), then you need to contact the data provider for clarification. For performance reasons, the limit is set to 5,000 rows. Larger files can be sent to info@marinespecies.org and will be returned as quickly as possible. After matching, the tool will return you a file with the AphiaIDs, LSIDs, valid names, authorities, classification and any other output you have selected. The WoRMS LSID is used for DwC:scientificNameID. A complete online manual is available at http://www.marinespecies.org/tutorial/taxonmatch.php. 3.0.1.2 Step 2: Match with other registers The LifeWatch taxon match compares your taxon list to multiple taxonomic standards. Matching with multiple registers gives an indication of the correct spelling of a name, regardless of its environment. If a name would not appear in any of the registers, this could indicate a mistake in the scientific name and the name should go back to the provider for additional checking/verification. Contrary to the WoRMS taxon match, when several matching options are available, the LifeWatch taxon match only mentions “no exact match found, multiple possibilities” instead of listing the available options. If multiple options are available, these should be looked up and matched manually. Currently, this web service matches the scientific names with the following taxonomic registers: World Register of Marine Species – WoRMS Catalogue of Life – CoL Integrated Taxonomic Information System – ITIS Pan-European Species-directories Infrastructure – PESI Index Fungorum – IF International Plant Names Index – IPNI Global Names Index - GNI Paleobiology Database - PaleoDB 3.0.1.3 Step 3: Is taxon marine? The Interim Register of Marine and Non-marine Genera (IRMNG) matching services are available through http://www.irmng.org/, as well as through the LifeWatch taxon match. "],["lifewatch_qc.html", "", " 3.0.2 Geographic and data format quality control These Data validation and QC services are available on the LifeWatch portal at http://www.lifewatch.be/data-services. 3.0.2.1 Geographical service This service allows to upload a file and to plot the listed coordinates on a map. Using this web service does not require knowledge of GIS. This service allows a visual check of the available locations and makes it possible to easily identify points on land or outside the scope or study area. Geographic data are essential for OBIS and the experience is that a lot of these data is incomplete or contains errors. A visual check of the position of the sampling locations is thus a simple way of filtering out obvious errors and improving the data quality. Latitude and longitude need to be in WGS84, decimal degrees. This format is also necessary for the OBIS Schema and for uploading the dataset to IPT (Darwin Core). 3.0.2.2 OBIS data format validation This is the most extensive check currently available and is available for data that are structured according to the OBIS Schema. This validation service checks the following items: Are all mandatory fields completed, what are the missing fields? Are the coordinates in the correct format (decimal degrees, taking into account the minimum and maximum possible values)? Are the sampling points on land or in water? Is the information in the date-fields valid (e.g. month between 1-12)? Can the taxon name be matched with WoRMS? This tool undertakes several actions simultaneously. In a first step, this data service allows you to map your own column headers to the field names used in the OBIS Schema. When you then run the format validation service, the following actions are performed: A check of the mandatory fields of the OBIS Scheme. If mandatory fields would be missing, these will be listed separately, so you can complete them. Without these fields, the dataset cannot be accepted by the OBIS node. A listing of all the optional fields of the OBIS Scheme that are available in your file. Validation of the content of a number of fields: Latitude &amp; longitude: Are the values inside the world limit? (yes/no); Are the values different from zero? (yes/no); Are the values situated in the marine environment (sea/ocean) (=prerequisite of a marine dataset)? (yes/no) Date-related fields: Do the year-month-day fields form a valid date? (yes/no) Do the start- and end-date fields form a valid date? (yes/no) Scientific name: Is the scientific name available in WoRMS? (yes/no) When yes: Indication whether taxon is marine or not Indication whether taxon name is valid or not Indication of the taxonomic rank After matching with WoRMS, the report gives a brief overview containing: the number of exact matches the number of fuzzy (=non-exact) matches the number of non-matches the number of errors that might have occurred during matching For each of the above steps, the result report lists the number of records that passes the check. The tool also makes a ‘grand total’ of these results, indicating if the quality of record is sufficient to be imported into OBIS, taking into account the results of the above mentioned checks. If the file contains fields that do not match the OBIS schema, these are also listed. Fields that cannot be mapped to the OBIS schema will not be uploaded in OBIS. After this data format check, a number of columns are added to the originally uploaded file, where the results of each step are listed. Each check is basically a yes/no question, which is translated to a 1 (yes) or 0 (no) value in the results file and is thus easy to interpret.

If there is a node in that list that you are interested in locating, searching for and possibly fixing MoF issues, select the Node from the list, then select a dataset (displaying a high percentage of missing ID(s)), and scroll down to the MEASUREMENT TYPE report Example, selected OBIS USA, then selected Florida Keys Reef Visual Census 1994, and scrolled down to MEASUREMENT TYPES section: To locate other datasets using these MEASUREMENT TYPES, use this active filtering MoF tool https://mof.obis.org/, sort by measurementType (click column header) and scroll to measurementType(s) of interest For MEASUREMENT TYPE “Number of species observed during time period” has only one entry, which is missing associated ID. To see which datasets are using the listed measurementType, measurementTypeID combination, click on the number of records which is the last column. All are from OBIS USA. For MEASUREMENT TYPE “fish length” … To see which datasets are using this also listed measurementType, measurementTypeID combination, click on the number of records which is the last column. There are two records for fish length, one missing an ID and the other using S06, which may not be the preferred ID for this measurementType: Also, while scrolling through this report, you may notice something you would like to further research, click the record count value to see a list of datasets and associated node(s) using this noted type/ID. NOTE: Current USE does not indicate CORRECT use: To see BODC label for the provided ID, click the Find button, second last column: This is showing a different label from the (variety of) measurementType provided. To see which datasets are using a specific measurementType / ID combination, click the records count, last column: Things you are looking to clean up: If measurementTypeID is empty this should be updated. If the same measurementType (with same meaning/purpose) is using multiple measurementTypeIDs, these should be fixed to a single, preferred BODC vocab value. "],["data_publication.html", "4 Data publication and sharing", " 4 Data publication and sharing OBIS nodes can accept any data files from its data sources or data providers, and they publish these data on their OBIS nodes IPT, which are harvested by central OBIS. The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is developed and maintained by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). GBIF maintains an IPT manual. See here for specific OBIS instructions: 4.0.1 IPT Contents Introduction Installation Registration Publish your data Upload data Map to Darwin Core Add metadata Publish your data Publish your data as a dataset paper 4.0.1.1 Introduction The biodiversity datasets and its metadata are published in OBIS using the Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT), developed by GBIF. The IPT software assists the user in mapping data to valid Darwin Core terms and archiving and compressing the Darwin Core content with: (i) a descriptor file: meta.xml that maps the core and extensions files to Darwin Core terms, and describes how the core and extensions files are linked, and (ii) the eml.xml file, which contains the dataset metadata in Ecological Metadata Language (EML) format. For instructions on how to enter the metadata go to EML. Al these components (i.e. core file, extension files, descriptor file and metadata file), compressed together (as a .zip file), comprise the Darwin Core Archive. 4.0.1.2 Installation OBIS nodes can decide to install and manage their IPT on their own institutional servers or use (at no charge!) the OBIS servers in Oostende, Belgium, provided as in-kind by the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ), which also runs the European OBIS node (EurOBIS). VLIZ also ensures the IPT instances run on the latest version (important for security updates). Here is an overview of the IPT instances hosted in Oostende: http://ipt.iobis.org/. Please contact the secretariat at info@iobis.org if you would like OBIS to host your IPT. To install your own IPT, please follow the instructions in the GBIF IPT manual. 4.0.1.3 Registration When you have installed your IPT, please provide the IPT instance URL to the OBIS secretariat, so your IPT is included in the data harvesting process. OBIS recommends to share the data as widely as possible including with other networks such as GBIF. On 13 October 2014, a cooperation agreement was signed between the secretariats of IOC-UNESCO/OBIS and GBIF in which the two parties recognized the two initiatives (OBIS and GBIF) as complementary with common goals (and in particular OBIS’s role in Marine Biodiversity Data). Together they agreed to work towards maximizing the quantity, quality, completeness and fitness for use of marine biodiversity data, accessible through OBIS and GBIF and in particular in the development of data standards (DwC), technology (IPT), maximizing fitness for use, development of biodiversity indicators for assessments, enhance capacity through training and coordinate approaches to the global science/policy interface. At the 4th session of the OBIS Steering Group (SG-OBIS-IV, Feb 2015), it was recommended that GBIF should harvest OBIS tier 2 nodes if OBIS tier 2 nodes could also harvest marine datasets from their GBIF nodes. In this way OBIS could work directly with the entire marine community and promote its standards and best practices. It was not recommended that iOBIS set up a separate IPT for GBIF to harvest, since this would mean a duplication of effort. In order to publish data with GBIF, the OBIS node also need to become a data publisher in GBIF, and link the IPT installation with this publishing organization. OBIS nodes are encouraged to use the OBIS node name as the publishers’s name, unless the host institution requires its institutional name to be used. In the latter case, reference to the OBIS node can be added in the description, as well as between brackets in the title. The name of the IPT instance can also refer to the OBIS node. OBIS nodes are also encouraged to select OBIS as the endorsing organization. In this way, the OBIS node is also listed on the OBIS page at GBIF. 4.0.1.4 Publish your data With regard to populating the IPT with marine data for OBIS, there are two possible approaches: Manager driven: You as node manager take the responsibility of describing, checking and uploading the data and metadata to the IPT. The data provider can send you the data ‘as such’ or you can make agreements with your providers on the accepted OBIS data format and standards. This approach will give you a very good knowledge of what data is available. It can be time-consuming, as (extended) communication with the data provider will be necessary to document the metadata and to re-format the data to the OBIS standards. User driven: You as node manager can guide (some of your) data providers to publish the data and metadata to the IPT themselves. Your main task will be to make sure that all relevant information and data for OBIS is available and that you perform the necessary quality checks before the data are released to OBIS. Once the Darwin Core Archive is created, the data provider should inform the node manager of this action, so he or she can do the necessary quality control checks. In order for the node manager to be able to look at the dataset, the data provider should add him or her as a “resource manager” to this specific dataset. In most cases, there will be a combination of these two approaches. The chosen approach will largely depend on the capacity, availability and willingness of your data provider to invest extra time in formatting and thoroughly describing their data. If you – as node manager – would prefer a partly user driven approach, the following steps to publishing marine data to OBIS briefly explains how you or a data provider can upload, standardize and publish a dataset on the OBIS node IPT, without the hassle of installing and maintaining an IPT instance. The data are published in your organization’s name. This guide is based on the Canadensys 7-step guide to publishing marine data: Desmet, P. &amp; C. Sinou. 2012. 7-step guide to data publication. Canadensys. http://community.canadensys.net/publication/data-publication-guide. :exclamation: Make sure you have obtained the rights from the data owners to publish their data! 4.0.1.4.1 Create your resource on the IPT The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT), developed by GBIF, is an open source web application that can be customized by the OBIS node manager. The IPT-instance is used to publish and register all the datasets. To be able to create and manage your own dataset (called a “resource” by GBIF), you will need a user account. Contact your node manager to create one for you. Once you have your account, login at the top of the IPT page. Click on the tab Manage resources: it will display all the datasets you are managing and will be empty at first. You can create a new resource at the bottom of the page. Follow the GBIF IPT manual for more detailed instructions. The first thing that needs to be completed is the shortname of your resource. This shortname uniquely identifies your resource (=dataset) and will eventually show up in the URL of this resource on IPT. These shortname identifiers are also used to create folders on the IPT and they cannot be changed. We therefore advise that the shortname: is unique, descriptive and short (max. 100 characters) does not contain a space, comma, accents or special characters Shortname good examples: VLIZ_benthos_NorthSea_2000 UBC_algae_specimens … :exclamation: When you would delete a resource, please inform your node manager of this action! If you create a test-file, please include _test at the end of your shortname. You can also create an entirely new resource by uploading an existing archived resource. See the IPT manual section Upload a DwC-A for instructions. Please note the IPT has a 100MB file upload limit, however, there is no limit to the size of a Darwin Core Archive that the IPT can export/publish. Refer to the File upload section in the IPT manual, to find out how to work around the file upload limit. Once you have created your resource, you will see an empty resource overview page. 4.0.1.5 Upload data Uploading your source file to the IPT is easy: go to &gt; your resource overview page &gt; Source Data and click on Choose File. You might want to compress/zip your source file first to improve the upload speed of large files. The IPT will unzip them automatically once received. Follow the IPT manual for more detailed instructions (including the option to use multiple source files or to upload via a direct database connection). Accepted formats are delimited text files (csv, tab and files using any other delimiter), either directly or compressed as zip or gzip. Once your source file has been uploaded correctly, a source file detail page will be shown, displaying how the IPT has interpreted your file (number of columns, rows, header rows, character encoding, delimiters, etc.). Click the preview button to verify everything is correct, click anywhere on the screen to exit the preview, then click save. 4.0.1.6 Map your data to Darwin Core Biodiversity data are published in the Darwin Core standard. It includes a list of defined terms and allows your data to be understood and used by others. It also allows an aggregator like OBIS or GBIF to integrate your data with other datasets. Darwin Core mapping is the process of linking the fields in your resource file with the appropriate Darwin Core terms. It is the most challenging step in publishing your data for two reasons: 1) the list of Darwin Core terms can be overwhelming, so it might be difficult to select the ones that are appropriate for your dataset, and 2) the IPT currently only allows one-to-one mapping of fields, so the ease of mapping will depend on your database structure and on the feasibility of exporting as close to Darwin Core as possible. Contact your node manager or the OBIS secretariat at info@iobis.org to guide you through the steps, review your mapping, suggest terms etc. You can find more information regarding Darwin Core mapping in the IPT manual (including core types, extensions, auto-mapping, default values, value translation, etc.). 4.0.1.7 Add metadata Metadata enables users to discover, assess, understand and attribute your dataset for their particular needs, so it pays off to invest some time providing them. Go to your resource overview page &gt; Metadata and click Edit to open the metadata editor. Any information you provide here will be visible on the resource homepage and bundled together with your data when you publish. Follow the OBIS metadata standards and best practices, or check the IPT manual for detailed instructions about the metadata editor. 4.0.1.8 Publish your data Go to your resource overview page &gt; Published Release and click Publish. The IPT will now generate your data as Darwin Core, and combine the data with the metadata and package it as a standardized zip-file called a “Darwin Core Archive”. See the IPT manual for more details. :exclamation: Hitting the “publish” button does not mean that your dataset is available to everyone, it is still private, with access limited to the resource managers. It will only be publicly available when you have changed Visibility &gt; Public, and it will only be harvested by GBIF when you can Visibility &gt; Registered. The last step is not needed for OBIS to harvest your datasets. Please do not register your dataset with GBIF if your dataset is already published in GBIF by another publisher. Back on the resource overview page &gt; Published Release, you can see the details of your first published dataset, including the publication date and the version number. Since your dataset is published privately, the only thing left to do is to click Visibility &gt; Public (see the IPT manual) to make it available to everyone. Warning: please do not do this with your test dataset. It is now listed on the IPT homepage and you can share and link to it, e.g.: http://ipt.vliz.be/resource.do?r=kielbay70. This would be a good time to notify any regional or thematic network you are involved in, which can also have an interest in your dataset. Your published dataset is a static snapshot of your data and will not change until you upload an updated source file and click publish again or publish a new version (do not create a new resource). This procedure has the advantage that your dataset is always available, does not require a live internet connection to your database and can be easily shared. It also allows you to control the publication process more precisely: version 1, version 2, etc. and users are informed of how recent the data are (via the last publication date). To view an older version of the metadata about the resource, just add the trailing parameter &amp;v=n to the URL where v stands for “version”, and n gets replaced by the version number, e.g., http://ipt.vliz.be/ilvo/resource.do?r=zoopl_bpns&amp;v=1. In this way, specific versions of a resource’s EML, RTF, and DwC-A files can be retrieved. Please note, the IPT’s Archival Mode must be turned on in order for old versions of DwC-A to be stored (see Configure IPT settings section of the IPT manual). 4.0.1.9 Publish your metadata as a data paper The Metadata expressed in the EML Profile standard can also be downloaded as a Rich Text Format (RTF) file. The latter can serve as a draft manuscript for a data paper (First database-derived ‘data paper’ published in journal, which can be submitted for peer-review to e.g. a Pensoft journal. "],["access.html", "5 Data access 5.1 Mapper 5.2 R package 5.3 API 5.4 Full exports", " 5 Data access 5.1 Mapper https://mapper.obis.org The mapper allows users to visualize and inspect subsets of OBIS data. A variety of filters (taxonomic, geographic, time, data quality) is available and multiple layers can be combined in a single view. Layers can be downloaded as CSV files. 5.2 R package https://github.com/iobis/robis The robis R package has been developed to facilitate connecting to the OBIS API from R. The package can be installed from CRAN or from GitHub (latest development version). The package documentation including a function reference and a getting started vignette is available at https://iobis.github.io/robis/. 5.3 API https://api.obis.org/ Both the mapper and the R package are based on the OBIS API which can be used by third party developers as well. 5.4 Full exports https://obis.org/data/access/ Full exports of the quality controlled presence records as CSV or Parquet (see below). "],["dataquality.html", "5.5 Data quality flags", " 5.5 Data quality flags OBIS performs a number of quality checks on the data it receives. Records may be rejected if the quality does not meet certain expectations. In other cases quality flags are attached to the occurrence records. The checks we perform as well as the associated flags are documented here. There are several ways to inspect the quality flags associated with a specific dataset or any other subset of data. Data downloaded through the mapper and the R package will include a column named flags which contains a comma separated list of flags for each record. In addition, the data quality panel on the dataset and node pages has a flag icon which can be clicked to get an overview of all flags and the number of records affected. This table includes quality flags, but also annotations from the WoRMS annotated names list. When OBIS receives a scientific name which cannot be matched with WoRMS automatically, it is sent to the WoRMS team. The WoRMS team will then annotate the name to indicate if and how the name can be fixed. Documentations about these annotations will be added here soon. Clicking any of these flags will take you to a table showing the affected records. For example, this is a list of records from a single dataset which have the no_match flag, indicating that no LSID or an invalid LSID was provided, and the name could not be matched with WoRMS. The column originalScientificName contains the problematic names, as scientificName is used for the matched name. At the top of the page there’s a button to open the occurrence records in the mapper where they can be downloaded as CSV. The occurrence table also has the flags column, so when inspecting non matching names for example it’s easy to check if the names at hand have any WoRMS annotations: Inspecting flags using R is also very easy. The example below fetches the data from a single dataset, and lists the flags and the number of records affected.
